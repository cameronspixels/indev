      <p class="blog--info--date">24/12/2017</p>
      <p class="blog--info--name">by Cameron Barnes</p>
      <div class="section--text--blog">
        <p class="section--top--text section--paragraph">If there’s one thing that I was always fairly certain of, it’s that I would’ve likely ended up working in the digital space. I didn’t always know where or how I’d get there, but ask anyone who knew me throughout the past 5 or 6 years of sitting in front of computers, and you’d be told that it was inevitable. It was obvious to me that digital was growing at a crazy rate, even though I had no indicator as to the actual scale. Looking at the <a class="link--regular"  href="https://technation.techcityuk.com/" title="Tech Nation report online">Tech Nation report</a> and the figures now, you'll note that <a class="link--regular" href="https://technation.techcityuk.com/pm-fotargetreward/" title="Theresa May Tech Nation foreword">even Theresa May's on board</a>.</p>
        <p class="section--paragraph">My technical skills were always an asset to me. Asking when I was 14 or 15, and I would’ve told you that I wanted to be a game developer. Minecraft — <a class="link--regular" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/16/minecraft-game-no-rules-changed-gaming" title="Guardian article on Minecraft's success">the industry-defining indie game developed by Mojang</a> — was on the up and presented this great, developer-friendly sandbox environment. I couldn’t imagine building something like that from the ground up, but being so open, it was a great platform to learn through modding.</p>

        </figure>
        <p class="section--top--text section--paragraph">I wanted to be more creative and lost the heart for programming along the way. Once more, if I look back on that, it was a shame. I went to college studying IT and chose a graphics &amp; media route, as opposed to a programming one. We dabbled in C for a bit, and though I found it fairly easy to pick up having understood the fundamentals of Java (even if I’d forgotten exactly how to write it at this point), I longed for something a little more fulfilling.</p>
        <p class="section--paragraph">The indecision there meant that I didn’t consider university too much, or even understand entirely how it worked. I found a Digital Media/Marketing course browsing through UCAS one day, and though I still can’t put my finger on why, decided that it would be the only choice. With offers from all universities that I applied to, I chose MMU.</p>
        <p class="section--paragraph">Perhaps inevitable given the impulse in the decision, I didn’t really ever feel it for marketing. I reasonably well in it, given the lack of real interest. I was part of groups that made this <a class="link--regular" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBbVDU4mq30" title="Swizzels' Love Hearts video">advertisement for Swizzels’ Love Hearts brand</a>, and created this <a class="link--regular" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByvNqwTNzDddcjI2N255TFhrMFE/view?usp=sharing" title="PDF of Flux Fitness portfolio">theoretical brand extension for Sony PlayStation</a> (be warned, though it does NOT download automatically, that links to a big .PDF file). We managed solid firsts for both of those through extensive research and well-thought presentation.</p>

        <p class="section--top--text section--paragraph">However, I did decide to switch my graduation route to Web Development in my final year. I had a thing for the coding aspect of websites ever since I started, and the front-end allows me to squeeze in that itch for creativity. It took a while and a lot of back and forth, but I think that I’ve been dropped in the right place this time around.</p>
        <p class="section--paragraph">This was perhaps the context that I was missing when previously learning these programming skills. I didn't have what I would've considered to be a 'real' reason to be extending my Java knowledge, but I've now seen something that I can apply what I learnt previously in programming to.</p>
        <p class="section--paragraph">With the intention of progressing the web field, I’ve opted to delve into as much as I can. I love listening to podcasts, especially when doing things like commuting or getting other work done. As such, I found some relevant to the web; <a class="link--regular" href="https://syntax.fm/" title="Syntax.fm podcast">Syntax (though they dive a little deeper)</a>, <a class="link--regular" href="http://shoptalkshow.com/" title="Shop Talk podcast">Shop Talk</a>, and <a class="link--regular" href="https://responsivewebdesign.com/podcast/" title="Responsive Web Design podcast">A Responsive Web Design Podcast</a> are my regular choices. I’ve also taken to reading on the topic - the <a class="link--regular" href="https://abookapart.com/" title="A Book Apart books">A Book Apart ones</a> are great, and short! I then look to attend conferences and workshops where time allows going forward. I was recently at <a class="link--regular" href="https://2017.manchester.wordcamp.org/" title="Wordcamp Manchester 2017">Wordcamp Manchester 2017</a>, and have a couple of workshops lined up.</p>
